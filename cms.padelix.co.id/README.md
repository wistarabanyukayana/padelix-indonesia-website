API endpoints are auto-generated by Strapi based on content types.

### Example Content Types (from codebase):

- **contact-signup**: `/api/contact-signups`
- **global**: `/api/globals`
- **home-page**: `/api/home-pages`
- **product**: `/api/products`

## Troubleshooting

- **Strapi CMS on cPanel:**  
  Use Node.js version below 20 for `npm install` if you encounter memory issues, but run Strapi with Node.js 20+ (Strapi 5 requires Node 20+).
